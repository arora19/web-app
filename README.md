Hotel Management System:
This project, developed as part of the CMPSC 431W course, aimed at creating a Hotel Management System. This web application, backed by a MySQL database, assists a small hotel in managing and running its operations, providing travelers with a comfortable stay for their holidays or business trips.

Project Specifications:
The application implements an HTTP interface to the database using PHP and is designed to run on a dedicated server.

Database Design:
The database is structured in the 3rd normal form, consisting of at least eight tables that represent various aspects of the hotel's operations. Keys and indexes are defined to handle tens of thousands of instances/records, with a subset of realistic data used for demonstration purposes.

Functionality:
The application includes at least 10 functions for managing the hotel's data, such as inserting, deleting, updating data, and generating sorted reports. A complex query that joins at least five tables in a meaningful way is also included, providing valuable insights into the hotel's operations.

User Interaction:
The application offers a user-friendly interface, allowing staff to select items from a list, either through a direct list, a drop-down list, or radio buttons.

Creativity and Completeness:
While the primary foundation of the application is in PHP/MySQL, the hotel management system goes beyond this, offering a practical and useful tool for managing small hotels.
